files required to be present (visible) inside the docker container:

- .idea/libraries/*.xml -> must contain the <ANNOTATIONS> element that reference the external annotations dir. Example:
    <ANNOTATIONS>
      <root url="file://$PROJECT_DIR$/../intellij-external-annotations" />
    </ANNOTATIONS>

- inspection profile xml file in .idea/inspectionProfiles/ (or anywhere else with newer groovy script)
- ~/.m2/repository with all deps : not really required but speeds up project opening since it avoids to download all deps again
- external annotations

not required (at least for maven projects)
- *.iml

Todo:
- create a maven plugin that adds the <ANNOTATIONS> in the the libraries/*.xml files + optionally the <annotations-path> to the ".iml files
